        <p class="description-text">    I made this poster in January 2021 and submitted it to the <a class="textlink" href="https://www.wlia.org/tag/map-contest/">Wisconsin Land Information Association (WLIA)</a> for their annual map contest.
        </p>
        <h2 align="left">Background</h2>
        <p class="description-text">    After drafting some ideas on paper, I made this map using QGIS and Adobe Illustrator. This map has larger dimensions than my other maps because it is supposed to be an informative poster. The WLIA <map>
           contest has multiple entries, and this map was my entry for the poster contest. I also submitted a map for the "Most Unique" competition.
        </map>
        </p>
        <h2 align="left">Idea</h2>
        <p class="description-text">    When I was reading news articles about the exodus of Silicon Valley companies, I immediately recognized that there was a geographical story to tell.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">    At first, I wanted to explain why Silicon Valley was declining relative to places like Texas and Florida, specifically Austin and Miami. However, an <a class="textlink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/opinion/silicon-valley-exodus.html">opinion piece</a>
          by Margaret O'Mara made me rethink the efficacy of a map that incorrectly portrayed Silicon Valley as some desolate place. The fact is that it is an economic powerhouse.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">    I decided to look further into the places that the tech companies were going to. I was already drawn toward Austin, knowing that at the end of 2020, Austin was on track to becoming the next US city with over one million people.
          What I saw in Austin was a legacy of technological enterprise spanning multiple generations. Once I found the convenient and apparently comprehensive company data on the <a class="textlink" href="https://www.austinchamber.com/economic-development/business-climate/relocations-expansions">
          Austin Chamber of Commerce</a> website, I knew that my map would be about Austin.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">    The Austin Chamber of Commerce recorded the businesses that relocated to or expanded in the Austin Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The data included the name of the companies, descriptions of the companies' goods and services, the month of the announced
          action (expand and/or relocate), and the municipality where the action took place.
        </p>
        <h2 align="left">Graph</h2>
        <p class="description-text">    I knew that I wanted to make a map showing where all of Austin's business growth in 2020 was located. I made the graph first, though. In December 2020, when I decided to make a map about Austin and its flourishing businesses, I read a 2020
          National Geographic magazine with an <a class="classlink" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2020/12/north-americas-most-valuable-resource-is-at-risk-feature/">article</a> about the challenges facing the Great Lakes.
          In the middle of the article was a graphic about the invasive species of the Great Lakes. There were illustrations of animals like sea lampreys and Pacific Salmon. There was also a timeline with dots stacked over it. Each dot represented an invasive species and the year
          that the dot was over corresponded with the year that the invasive species was first detected in the Great Lakes.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">    That inspired me to make a timeline of the business expansions and relocations in the Austin MSA. Since the data I found broke down the expansions and relocations by month, I made a timeline of the announced company expansions and relocations.
          I symbolized the dots according to what kind of activity it was (relocation and/or expansion) and whether the location was a branch or a headquarter.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">    Despite showing all of the companies, I wanted to focus on the technology industry since that would be most relevant to a general audience. So, I followed the example of the National Geographic chart and visually accented the businesses of interest.
          This meant that I singled out some examples of tech companies and provided annotations. Annotations make graphs easier to read and assist readers in seeing how the graph corroborates the overall message.
        </p>
        <h2 align="left">Map</h2>
        <p class="description-text">    The data provided the municipality of each company activity, but did not give their exact locations. I made a basemap of the Austin MSA on QGIS with DOT data. I added the specific locations of business activities after finding as many addresses as I could.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">    I didn't annotate the map as I did with the graph. I could have, but I wanted the map to be more holistic by displaying all of the companies without overemphasizing certain industries and undermining others.
        </p>
        <h2 align="left">Design</h2>
        <p class="description-text">    The poster is supposed to have a style that reminds people of tech companies. This stylization was not meant to be too overwhelming. I felt that the dark background, the heavy use of blue, and the sans-serif typeface all evoked a sense of modernity.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">
          I usually try to make an accommodating color palette, and in this case I did not add any red or green hues. I saved the yellow for the map so that it could stand out against the dark blue background. I created a slight fog-of-war effect on the map margins to remind the reader that the Austin
          MSA is part of a larger geography while still visually limiting the scope my area of interest. The relative sizing of the explanatory text, graph, and map was supposed to make the poster as whole as balanced as possible.
