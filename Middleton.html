        <p class="description-text">    This is my first cartography project outside of classwork and the UWCL. The <a class="textlink" href="https://town.middleton.wi.us/parks">Town of Middleton Parks & Rec</a> reached out to Madison area cartographers and requested a new trail map in the summer of 2020. Several people, including myself, agreed to work on the project.
        </p>
        <h2 align="left">Tasks</h2>
        <p class="description-text" align="left">The Park Commission of the Town of Middleton gave project workers three tasks:</p>
        <p class="bold-text" align="left" style="padding-left: 80px">1.) Create a set of trail maps for public usage</br></br>2.) Create a tool or a recommendation to help the Park Commission plan trails</br></br>3.) Compile coordinates of trailheads and park entrances for the Town
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">    The Park Commission chair elaborated on these tasks, stating that the Town did not necessarily need all of the work to be completed by project workers. As a project worker, the first task on my agenda was to create a proposal to present to the Park Commission. The Chair of the Park Commission contacted people who expressed
          interest in working on the project. The chair told prospective workers that the Commission's target users were people from the immediate area wishing to find trails and park entrances with ease. At the time, the Town did not have coordinates to their trailheads or park entrances, but rather located them according to adjacent land parcels.
          They also had a series of PDF maps on their website, which are still in use, though they find them difficult to understand. Some of these maps are displayed at majors parks and greenspaces in the Town. Six or seven people initially showed interest in the project, but most of them were preoccupied with other work.
          I ended up collaborating with my UWCL co-worker and classmate, <a class="textlink" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-riebe-07a25a1a2/">Josh Riebe</a>. We prioritized the first and third tasks after discussing our schedules and workloads.
        </p>
        <h2 align="left">Proposal</h2>
        <p class="description-text">    One of the first things we figured out while drafting the proposal was how we would divide our labor. Since the purpose of obtaining trailhead and park coordinates was to enable casual navigation, the coordinates did not have to be highly accurate.
          As long as the coordinates would enable successful navigation with map applications, they would fulfill their purpose. I spent my summer biking, so I decided to bike to the Town of Middleton and
          record GPS coordinates with my phone while doing so. I verified my coordinates by plugging them into several mapping applications to see if they located trailheads and park entrances correctly. I had more web mapping experience than Josh at the time, and I also had fewer obligations than Josh. So, we decided that I would work on an
          interactive map while Josh would make corresponding maps for PDFs. I consulted with <a class="textlink" href="https://geography.wisc.edu/cartography/people/Roth.html#education">Robert Roth</a> on making an effective proposal. Josh and I then worked out details such as use case scenarios, design details, interactivity details, desired pay rates, and objectives.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">    On July 13, 2020, Josh and I presented our proposal to the Park Commission during their meeting. The chair gave good feedback on our presentation, and most of the Commission agreed that the maps would improve naviagtion with better design and interactivity. However, I failed to make a good case for the modifiability of the interactive map. The Town
          wanted to create new trails and improve existing ones, making the modifiability of our product crucial. I proposed a method in which the map would display trails using appended SVGs. Styling these SVGs would be harder, but the advantage of using them would be that I could code all of the proposed trails ahead of time, as inert blocks. That way, when any changes occured, someone
          could simply activate the code. The Commission members were reserved despite my proposed method, but fortunately someone said that a GIS specialist connected to the Town could implement any necessary changes in the future. Ultimately, the Commission decided that Josh and I could begin working if we so wished, but they were not sure if they wanted to pay us at our proposed rate.
          Josh and I were led to believe that the Commission would eventually agree to pay us, and we both had difficult Fall semesters approaching. Based on these two circumstances, I decided to follow through with the work.
