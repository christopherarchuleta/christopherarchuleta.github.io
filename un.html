        <p class="description-text">    These are a few of the illustrations that I worked on for a book called 
          <a class="textlink" href="https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3898826?ln=en"><i>Mapping for a Sustainable World</i></a>, which was jointly published by the UN and the International Cartographic Association (ICA).</p>
        <h2 align="left">The Book</h2>
        <p class="description-text">    The authors of <i>Mapping for a Sustainable World</i> wanted to demonstrate the usefulness of maps for communicating patterns in real-world data that are otherwise difficult to recognize.</p>
        <p class="description-text">    <i>Mapping for a Sustainable World</i> uses UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) data. The <a class="textlink" href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a> was introduced in 2015 to encourage the world’s countries to improve the state of the world. 
          In order to define and gauge this improvement, or “sustainable development”, the UN created 17 SDGs. The Agenda describes the process of SDG creation as follows:</p>
        <p class="description-text" style="padding-left:1em;padding-right:1em;">    The Goals and targets are the result of over two years of intensive public consultation and engagement with civil society and other stakeholders around the world, which paid particular attention to the voices of the poorest and most vulnerable. 
            This consultation included valuable work done by the General Assembly Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals and by the United Nations, whose Secretary-General provided a synthesis report in December 2014.</p>
        <p class="description-text">    The UN proceeded to gather data from many of the world’s countries to measure their progress in achieving these goals. <i>Mapping for a Sustainable World</i> depicts this data in a myriad of ways to make the case for good cartographic practices. 
          To do this, the book covers topics typically explored in a cartography class, such as design principles, map types, and user considerations.</p>
        <p class="description-text">    Map readers and map makers alike should be familiar with the nature and origin of the data that they’re presented with. The book does this in the first section by explaining what SDGs are and presents them in the context of crucial topics such as normalization.</p>
        <p class="description-text">    Thus, the book is both a unique presentation of UN SDGs and a unique introduction to cartography.</p>
        <h2 align="left">My Contribution</h2>
        <p class="description-text">    In the summer of 2019, Robert Roth, my professor at the time, who is also the academic director of the University of Wisconsin Cartography Lab, offered me a wonderful opportunity.</p>
        <p class="description-text">    He told me that he was one of the authors of an upcoming book that the UN and ICA would publish together, and that I could contribute as a student cartographer working for the Lab. I will always be thankful that I was given the chance to contribute to a UN and ICA publication.
          I was tasked with examining and categorizing the data. I also looked for data errors and anomalies, and made recommendations for potential maps. Then I drafted several maps, which typically followed design specifications that helped to establish the style of the book.</p>
        <p class="description-text">    During the process, I learned that my preconceived notion of data was unrealistic. 
          While I expected some of the uncertainty in the data, such as the loss of accuracy from acquiring data on a national scale, I was admittedly surprised by how many blatant errors and nonexistent entries I found.</p>
        <p class="description-text">    This was also my first direct exposure to the politics of cartography. People who were working on the project brought up several nuanced issues that nonexperts would probably overlook. These issues pertained to things like semantics, toponymy, and geographical representation.</p>

        <h2 align="left">Background</h2>
        <p class="description-text">    In December 2017, I joined <a class="textlink" href="https://www.facebook.com/letsBundleUp/">Bundle Up</a>, a UW-Madison student organization, as a homeless outreach volunteer. After several months with Bundle Up, I decided that talking with Madison’s unhoused community and personally helping them was my favorite outreach component. So I joined <a class="textlink" href="https://friendsofthestatestreetfamily.org/">Friends of the State Street Family (FSSF)</a> in September 2018 as an outreach volunteer. FSSF is a homeless outreach organization based in Madison, WI that offers donations, housing assistance, employment information, advocacy, and social support.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">    A couple of months after joining FSSF, while also continuing my service in Bundle Up, Roth’s introductory cartography class began their final projects. For the final, students were expected to create a map, typically in the form of a print map. As a student, I had to produce a map that showed my understanding of the basic cartographic design principles. During the course, I acquainted myself with the process of data acquisition and learned tools such as ArcMap, Adobe Illustrator, and MapShaper. In the event that I deviated from the cartographic norms presented to us in the course, I was expected to defend my design choices, which is an important skill to have. Rob encouraged his students to work on a personally meaningful project, so I decided to make a map that connected to my work with the homeless. Mobilizing unpaid volunteers to help hundreds of people on a daily basis isn’t easy, so I wanted to create a map that conveyed the magnitude of that mobilization. There are multiple ways to do this, but I decided to map the volunteering component that I was most familiar with, the in-person outreach.
        </p>
      </div>
        <h2 align="left">Data Collection</h2>
        <p class="description-text">    A typical day’ outreach with Bundle Up or FSSF covers a route similar to other days. Therefore, I took the liberty of using data from a single day as a proxy for an average of all days. I recorded the outcomes of all interactions of the September 21, 2018 FSSF outreach. I only took data from one day because logging the donations reduced my ability to actually help with the volunteering. My data was basic, consisting of the content, quantity, and location of a donation. I knew from experience that the spatial component of outreach was important because there are known hot spots where there are more people and more donations given. This first-hand data collection is what sets this map apart from my other ones, which are made from amalgamations and modifications of pre existing datasets and maps.
        </p>
        <h2 align="left">Design Process</h2>
        <p class="description-text">    Initially, I knew that the donation locations, donation types, and the donation sizes were going to occupy the top of the visual hierarchy. Prospective members of Bundle Up or FSSF, my target audience, would be able to grasp the scope and magnitude of a single outreach with a glimpse. Then, with more focused reading, the reader would first see the different kinds of donations and services. The vicinity of the donation route, with its respective labels, would recede to ground. I also decided in the first iteration that the map would take a dark theme to mimic the night time conditions that winter outreaches take place in.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">    Roth looked at a quick draft I made of my first idea. Since I wanted to focus on the numeracy, Roth suggested that I symbolize donations with a one-for-one method. Instead of multiplying the icon of a given donation to symbolize quantity as I did in the draft, I would make one icon for each donated object. This tactic does a better job of overwhelming the reader. As for the icons themselves, Rob gave me some lecture notes and referred me to some <a class="textlink" href="https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/how-maps-work-representation-visualization-and-design-2">literature.</a> This was my first exposure to icon construction, so Roth walked me through standard concepts such as sizing, silhouettes, and simplicity. The last main change to my map was the orientation from north-up to east-up. This made the largely east-west donation route a vertical axis on the map, acting as a sort of spine from which the donation icons would grow from on Letter size paper.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">    In the later iterations of the map, I saved the hues for symbolizing the icons. That’s because, on top of the specific donation, I wanted to group donations into three categories, with a particular hue corresponding to a particular category. Metro maps inspired me to use a nodal symbol for the donation locations, which I placed on a bold white line that symbolized the route. Though I collected the data on a FSSF outreach, I included the BundleUp storage site location on the map to reinforce its presence to student readers.
        </p>
        <p class="description-text">    I got most of the basemap data from OpenStreetMap via Geofabrik and projected it in ArcMap, generalized it in Illustrator, and stylized it in Illustrator.
        </p>
        <h2 align="left">Future</h2>
        <p class="description-text">    BundleUp showcased this map at three student org fairs and at the Spring 2019 kickoff meeting. It illustrated the importance of in-person outreach to prospective and new members. I will propose to FSSF to use this map for funding purposes. Many of the donations come from freely given items, but they’re often insufficient to cover all the needs of the homeless. So, outreach organizations often purchase items to have a comprehensive reserve of donations. A FSSF version of the map would have a different extent to focus more on the donation route and less on the UW campus. In any case, future iterations of the map will declutter the icons near the top for aesthetic and comprehension purposes.
