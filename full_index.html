              My main objective is to have a satisfying and impactful cartography career. As of March 2020, I am working toward this goal by studying cartography at the University and doing projects for the UW Cartography Lab (UWCL), its clients,
              and the users of its products. The purpose of this web page is to display some of my works, methods, activities, and networks for visitors like you to see. If you have any reason to contact me, please do so.

          <!-- <p align="right" class="col-md-9">This map is a slight revision of my final project for the Introduction to Cartography course at UW-Madison.
            Robert Roth taught the course when I took it in Fall 2018.
            <br><br>Bundle Up is a UW-Madison student organization that uses this map at informational meetings to show prospective members the impact of its outreach component.
             The outreach is directed toward the homeless population in Madison, WI.
            <br><br>In December 2017, someone from my scholarship group invited people at a meeting to participate in an in-person outreach to the homeless.
            A group of voulnteers, including myself, convened to personally distribute food, clothing, and hygiene donations on the streets of Madison that evening.
            The person who initiated the volunteer event recommended that I should join the organization that he was a part of to volunteer regularly.
            That is how I joined Bundle Up. After several months with that organization, I decided that the in-person outreach component was the volunteering aspect that best suited me.
            In September of 2018, I joined Friends of the State Street Family, abbreviated FSSF.
            FSSF is a homeless outreach organization based in Madison, WI that offers donations, housing and employment information, advocacy in community meetings, and social support.
            <br><br>A couple of months after joining FSSF, while also continuing my service in Bundle Up, Roth's introductory cartography class began their final projects.
            In a month's time, the cartography students were expected to create a printed map of their choosing.
            As one of these students, I had to produce a map that showed my understanding of basic cartographic design principles.
            Some of the key components of the course were the synergies of visual variables, the importance of generalization and presentation, the appropriate uses of different thematic maps, and the appropriate uses of projections.
            I acquainted myself with the process of data acquisition and using tools such as ArcMap, Adobe Illustrator, and MapShaper.
            In the event that I deviated from the cartographic norms presented to us in the course, I was expected to defend my design choices, an important skill to have.
            <br><br>Rob encouraged his students to work on a personally meaningful project, so I decided to make a map that connected to my work with the homeless.
            Mobilizing unpaid volunteers to help hundreds of people on a daily basis isn't easy, and I wanted to convey the magnitude of that mobilization.
            There are a multitude of ways to do this, but I decided to map the outreach component that I was most familiar with.
            That is, the in-person donations, which also serve the important purpose of gauging each person's unique situation by conversing with them.

            More details on the map's design process, data sources, and future are to come.</p> -->
